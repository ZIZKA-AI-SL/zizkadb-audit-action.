# ZizkaDB Audit: prove your AI agent's history is intact

Auditors, incident reviews and the EU AI Act ask the same question: **can you show what your agent did, and prove the record was not changed afterwards?** This action records your agent's run in ZizkaDB, checks every agent's hash chain, and produces an audit report with the exported history, attested by GitHub.

| Agent | Hash chain | Events | Deletions | Breaks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `refund-agent` | ✅ intact | 5 | 0 | 0 |

If an event was edited, inserted, reordered or deleted without a tombstone, the check reports **❌ broken**, names the event, and fails the step.

## Quick start

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write   # PR comment
  id-token: write        # attestation
  attestations: write    # attestation

jobs:
  agent-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with: { python-version: "3.12" }
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt zizkadb-sdk
      - uses: ZIZKA-AI-SL/zizkadb-audit-action@v1
        with:
          run: pytest tests/agent
```

The action:

1. **Starts ZizkaDB inside the runner** (the open-source single container). No account, no secrets; **the data never leaves the runner**.
2. **Runs your command** with `ZIZKADB_HOST` and `ZIZKADB_API_KEY` set, so the ZizkaDB SDK in your agent records there.
3. **Verifies each agent's hash chain**: every event's checksum and its link to the previous event, plus tombstones for deletions.
4. **Exports the full history** (NDJSON) with a SHA-256 per file.
5. **Writes `report.md` and `report.json`** and adds a **GitHub artifact attestation**, so anyone can later check that this workflow run produced them, unchanged:

   ```bash
   gh attestation verify report.md -R your-org/your-repo
   ```
6. **Uploads** everything as the `zizkadb-audit` artifact (kept 90 days; download and archive it for longer retention), and posts a summary in the job summary and on the pull request.

## Audit a running ZizkaDB

Point it at your self-hosted ZizkaDB, for example on a schedule:

```yaml
on:
  schedule: [{ cron: "0 6 * * 1" }]   # every Monday
jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: { contents: read, id-token: write, attestations: write }
    steps:
      - uses: ZIZKA-AI-SL/zizkadb-audit-action@v1
        with:
          host: https://zizkadb.example.com
          api-key: ${{ secrets.ZIZKADB_API_KEY }}
```

## What the report contains

- Repository, commit, workflow run and ZizkaDB version
- Per agent: result, events, deletions (tombstones), breaks, checksum mismatches, first and last event
- The problems found, in plain language, with event numbers
- The exported history files and their SHA-256
- Each agent's chain head (`report.json`), to store outside ZizkaDB and check later runs against
- What the evidence supports: automatic recording of events with timestamps (EU AI Act Article 12 record-keeping), traceability of each decision to its cause, and integrity of the record

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `run` | | Command that runs your agent or its tests. Required unless `host` is set. |
| `host` | | Audit an existing ZizkaDB instead of a local one. |
| `api-key` | | API key for `host`; pass it from a secret. |
| `agents` | all | Comma-separated agent names to audit. |
| `fail-on-broken` | `true` | Fail the step when a hash chain is broken. |
| `attest` | `true` | Attest the report and history (needs `id-token: write`, `attestations: write`). |
| `comment` | `true` | Post and update a PR comment (needs `pull-requests: write`). |
| `image` | `ghcr.io/zizka-ai-sl/zizkadb:latest` | ZizkaDB image for the local instance; pin a version for reproducible runs. |
| `github-token` | `${{ github.token }}` | Token used for the PR comment. |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `intact` | `true` if every chain is intact, `false` if not, empty if nothing was recorded |
| `agents` | Agents audited |
| `events` | Events verified |
| `report` | Path of `report.md` |
| `command-exit-code` | Exit code of `run` |

## Good to know

- **One agent per run** on the local instance: open-source ZizkaDB records one agent per install. Multiple agents, fleets and agent-to-agent recording are in [ZizkaDB Cloud](https://db.zizka.ai).
- **Telemetry.** The ZizkaDB SDK in your agent sends an anonymous install count; set `ZIZKADB_TELEMETRY: "false"` in the job's `env` to turn it off. [Details](https://github.com/ZIZKA-AI-SL/ZizkaDB/blob/main/docs/telemetry.md).
- **Why did the agent fail?** Use [ZizkaDB Why](https://github.com/ZIZKA-AI-SL/zizkadb-why-action) for causal chains in your PR.
- How the hash chain works: [ZizkaDB security docs](https://github.com/ZIZKA-AI-SL/ZizkaDB/blob/main/docs/security/assessment.md).

## Beyond CI

ZizkaDB runs on your own servers too: a tamper-evident audit log, causal `why()`, time travel, agent memory and search, on Postgres.
